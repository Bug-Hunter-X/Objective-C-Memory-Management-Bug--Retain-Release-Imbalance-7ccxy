The solution focuses on proper `release` or setting the object to `nil` when it's no longer needed:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) id myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myObject = [[NSObject alloc] init]; // Retain count increased
    // ... some code ...
    [self.myObject release]; // Release the object
    self.myObject = nil; // Good practice for cleanup
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [myObject release]; // Release in dealloc if not released elsewhere
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

In modern Objective-C using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` are managed automatically, reducing the risk of this specific error.  However, understanding these concepts remains crucial for debugging and working with older, non-ARC code.
