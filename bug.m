In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with properties declared using `retain` or `copy`.  If you don't properly balance `retain` calls with `release` or `autorelease` calls, it can lead to memory leaks or crashes due to over-releasing objects. This is often exacerbated when working with delegates or blocks that hold references to your objects.  For instance:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) id myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myObject = [[NSObject alloc] init]; // Retain count increased
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```
If `myObject` is not released properly (e.g., using `[myObject release]` or setting it to nil in `dealloc`), it causes a memory leak. Over-releasing using multiple `release` calls will result in a crash. Using ARC mitigates this to some extent but doesn't eliminate the potential for issues, especially when interfacing with non-ARC code or using legacy codebases.
